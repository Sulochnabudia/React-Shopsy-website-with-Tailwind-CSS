feat: Add Tailwind CSS for styling the main website

- Integrated Tailwind CSS into the React Shopsy project for enhanced styling.
- Configured Tailwind CSS by setting up the `tailwind.config.js` file.
- Updated the `index.css` file to include Tailwind's base, components, and utilities.
- Refactored existing CSS styles to utilize Tailwind's utility classes.
- Verified the responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility with Tailwind's default configuration.

Tailwind CSS simplifies the styling process by providing a set of utility-first classes that can be composed to build complex designs. This integration will help maintain consistent styling across the application and allow for easier and faster UI development.

Documentation and resources for Tailwind CSS can be found at https://tailwindcss.com/docs.
